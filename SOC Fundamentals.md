### **Goal**

Gain a clear understanding of the fundamentals of a Security Operations Center (SOC), focusing on detection and response, the roles and responsibilities of SOC team members, the concept of alert triage, and the tools and technologies that support SOC operations.

---------

### **Key Topics Covered**

### 1. Detection and Response

The main responsibility of a SOC team is to maintain effective **detection and response**. This involves continuously monitoring an organization’s network and systems from a centralized location using integrated security solutions. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, unauthorized activity, policy violations, and intrusions.

-   **Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses in devices or software (such as operating systems or applications) that attackers can exploit. For example, the SOC may identify unpatched Windows systems that need urgent updates. Although vulnerability management is not always directly the SOC’s task, unfixed vulnerabilities weaken the security posture of the organization.
    
-   **Unauthorized activity**: If an attacker gains access using stolen credentials, the SOC must quickly detect unusual behavior (such as login attempts from unexpected geographic locations) to limit damage.
    
-   **Policy violations**: Violations depend on company-specific rules but may include downloading pirated files or sending confidential information insecurely.
    
-   **Intrusions**: Unauthorized access through exploitation of web applications or infections from malicious websites must be promptly detected.
    

The SOC’s ability to detect such events ensures rapid response and containment before they escalate into major incidents.

### 2. Response

Once incidents are detected, the SOC provides support to the incident response process. This includes:

-   Minimizing the incident’s impact.
    
-   Conducting root cause analysis to understand how it happened.
    
-   Collaborating with the incident response team for containment, eradication, and recovery.
    

Response is not just reactive but also involves proactive investigation by experienced analysts.

### 3. The Three Pillars of a SOC

SOC maturity relies on the balance of **People, Process, and Technology**. These three pillars work together to ensure incidents are detected and responded to effectively.

-   **People**: Despite automation, human expertise is essential to reduce noise from the large number of alerts generated by tools. SOC team members include:
    
    -   _SOC Analyst (Level 1)_: First responders who handle basic triage of alerts and determine if they are harmful.
        
    -   _SOC Analyst (Level 2)_: Perform deeper investigation and correlation of alerts across multiple sources.
        
    -   _SOC Analyst (Level 3)_: Senior professionals who proactively hunt for threats and handle critical incidents, including containment and recovery.
        
    -   _Security Engineer_: Deploy and configure the security solutions that analysts rely on.
        
    -   _Detection Engineer_: Create and refine detection rules that underpin alerting systems.
        
    -   _SOC Manager_: Oversees processes, manages the SOC team, and communicates updates to leadership such as the CISO.
        
-   **Process**: Well-defined procedures ensure consistent handling of alerts, escalation, and incident management.
    
-   **Technology**: Security solutions reduce manual effort and centralize visibility across the network.
    

### 4. Alert Triage

Alert triage is the foundation of SOC work. It involves analyzing alerts to determine severity and priority by answering the **5 Ws** (What, When, Where, Who, Why).

**Example:**

-   _What?_ A malicious file was detected on a host.
    
-   _When?_ It was detected at 13:20 on June 5, 2024.
    
-   _Where?_ On the host “GEORGE PC.”
    
-   _Who?_ For the user George.
    
-   _Why?_ The file was downloaded from a pirated software website.
    

This structured approach ensures clarity in reports, which are escalated to higher-level analysts as tickets with detailed analysis and evidence. When critical activity is discovered, incident response and possibly forensic investigation are initiated.

### 5. Security Solutions and Technology

The SOC depends on advanced tools to centralize monitoring and automate detection. Key solutions include:

-   **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**: Collects logs from multiple devices (log sources) and applies detection rules to identify suspicious activity. Modern SIEMs enhance this by incorporating user behavior analytics, threat intelligence, and machine learning to improve accuracy.
    
-   **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**: Provides real-time and historical visibility into endpoint activity, enabling quick investigations and automated responses at the device level.
    
-   **Firewall**: Acts as a barrier between internal and external networks, monitoring traffic and blocking unauthorized connections. Detection rules within firewalls also identify and stop suspicious activity before it reaches the internal network.
    

These technologies significantly reduce the manual workload of the SOC team while improving detection accuracy.

## What I Learned

-   SOC teams focus on continuous monitoring for detection and response.
    
-   Key areas include identifying vulnerabilities, unauthorized activity, policy violations, and intrusions.
    
-   The SOC pillars—People, Process, and Technology—work together to create a mature and effective security environment.
    
-   Alert triage relies on answering the 5 Ws to prioritize and escalate alerts.
    
-   Security solutions such as SIEM, EDR, and firewalls centralize monitoring and enhance detection capabilities.
