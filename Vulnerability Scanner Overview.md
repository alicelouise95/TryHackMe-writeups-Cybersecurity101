**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** 2025-09-02

----------

### **Goal**

The main goal of this room was to understand the concept of vulnerability scanning, the types of scans, tools used for automated vulnerability scanning, and how to perform a practical vulnerability scan using OpenVAS.

---------

### **Key Topics Covered**

1.  **Understanding Vulnerabilities and Patching**  
    Digital devices often have vulnerabilities in their software or hardware that attackers can exploit. Hackers continuously search for these weaknesses to compromise systems or networks, potentially causing significant damage if vulnerabilities are not addressed promptly.  
    Once vulnerabilities are identified by defenders, organizations apply patches—changes or fixes to software or systems—to secure these vulnerabilities and prevent exploitation.
    
2.  **Vulnerability Scanning**  
    Vulnerability scanning is the inspection of digital systems to find weaknesses. Organizations store critical information in their infrastructure, so regular scanning is essential to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanning is also a compliance requirement in many regulatory standards, with recommendations ranging from quarterly to annual scans.  
    Manual vulnerability scanning is slow and prone to human error, especially in large networks. Automated vulnerability scanners solve this by allowing users to specify an IP address or network range. The scanner checks for vulnerabilities and generates a detailed, easy-to-read report.
    
    **Scan Types:**
    
    -   **Authenticated scans:** Require host credentials, providing detailed insight into the system’s threat surface.
        
    -   **Unauthenticated scans:** Conducted without credentials, useful for identifying vulnerabilities visible from outside the host.
        
    -   **Internal scans:** Conducted from inside the network.
        
    -   **External scans:** Conducted from outside the network.  
        The choice of scan type depends on context; authenticated scans are typically used internally, while unauthenticated scans are used externally.
        
3.  **Vulnerability Scanning Tools**  
    Several tools are commonly used for automated vulnerability scanning, each with unique features:
    
    -   **Nessus:** Developed as an open-source project in 1998 and became proprietary in 2005. Offers extensive scanning options, available in free (limited) and commercial versions. Requires on-premises deployment.
        
    -   **Qualys:** A subscription-based, cloud-hosted solution since 1999. Provides continuous scanning, compliance checks, asset management, and automatic alerts for detected vulnerabilities.
        
    -   **Nexpose:** Developed by Rapid7 in 2005, offers continuous network asset discovery, risk scoring, and compliance checks. Can be deployed on-premises or in hybrid mode.
        
    -   **OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System):** An open-source solution by Greenbone Security. Provides basic scanning features and is suitable for small organizations or individual systems. Less extensive than commercial tools but offers a complete scanning experience.
        
    
    Most vulnerability scanners provide detailed reports containing discovered vulnerabilities, their risk scores, and remediation guidance, often in exportable formats.
    
4.  **CVE and CVSS**
    
    -   **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):** Assigns unique reference numbers to vulnerabilities in software, published in a CVE database to inform users of potential threats. Example: CVE-2024-9374, where "CVE" is the prefix, "2024" is the discovery year, and "9374" is a unique identifier.
        
    -   **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):** Calculates severity of vulnerabilities considering factors like impact and exploitability. Scoring ranges:
        
        -   0.0–3.9: Low
            
        -   4.0–6.9: Medium
            
        -   7.0–8.9: High
            
        -   9.0–10: Critical
            
5.  **Practical Exercise: OpenVAS Setup and Scanning**  
    OpenVAS installation can be complex due to dependencies. Using Docker simplifies setup by running OpenVAS in a container that includes all dependencies:
    
    -   Install Docker (`sudo apt install docker.io`)
        
    -   Run OpenVAS container (`sudo docker run -d -p 443:443 --name openvas immauss/openvas`)
        
    
    **Performing a Vulnerability Scan:**
    
    1.  Open the OpenVAS dashboard and navigate to **Scans → Tasks**.
        
    2.  Click the star icon and select **New Task**.
        
    3.  Enter a task name.
        
    4.  Click the star next to **Scan Targets**, enter target machine name and IP, and create the target.
        
    5.  Select a scan configuration (e.g., Discovery, Full and fast, Host Discovery) and create the task.
        
    6.  Start the scan by clicking the green play button in the **Actions** menu.
        
    7.  After completion, click the task name to view scan details.
        
    8.  Click the results number to see a list of all discovered vulnerabilities and their severity.
        

## What I Learned

-   Vulnerabilities exist in almost all digital devices and must be patched promptly to prevent exploitation.
    
-   Automated vulnerability scanning saves time and increases accuracy compared to manual scanning.
    
-   Scan types (authenticated, unauthenticated, internal, external) determine the depth and perspective of the scan.
    
-   Tools like Nessus, Qualys, Nexpose, and OpenVAS provide varying capabilities for vulnerability scanning and reporting.
    
-   CVE provides unique identifiers for vulnerabilities, while CVSS scores indicate severity.
    
-   Docker simplifies OpenVAS installation, and OpenVAS allows practical vulnerability scanning and reporting.
