### **Goal**

To introduce the foundational concepts of databases and SQL, including database types, structure, core SQL statements, clauses, operators, and functions, enabling effective data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

---------

### **Key Topics Covered**


**1. Introduction to Databases**

-   Databases are organized collections of structured information or data that can be easily accessed, managed, and analyzed.
    
-   Data types stored can include authentication details, user-generated content, and historical records.
    
-   Two main categories:
    
    -   **Relational Databases (SQL):** Store structured data in tables with rows and columns, maintaining defined relationships between tables. Best for consistent and accurate data.
        
    -   **Non-relational Databases (NoSQL):** Store data in non-tabular formats such as JSON documents, suitable for flexible and variable data formats.
        

----------

**2. Database Structure**

-   **Tables:** The primary structure in a relational database that stores related data.
    
-   **Columns:** Define the attributes of data in a table.
    
-   **Rows:** Represent individual records.
    
-   **Primary Key:** A unique column identifying each record in a table.
    
-   **Foreign Key:** A column linking one table to another, enabling relational connections.
    

----------

**3. Database Management Systems (DBMS)**

-   Software interfaces allowing interaction with databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle Database, MariaDB).
    
-   Provide tools for retrieving, updating, and managing stored data.
    
-   SQL advantages: fast performance, ease of learning, reliability through structured data, and flexibility in analysis.
    

----------

**4. SQL Statements**

-   **CREATE DATABASE** / **DROP DATABASE**: Create or remove databases.
    
-   **SHOW DATABASES** / **USE DATABASE**: List or select a database.
    
-   **CREATE TABLE** / **DROP TABLE**: Create or remove tables.
    
-   **SHOW TABLES** / **DESCRIBE**: List tables and inspect their structure.
    
-   **ALTER TABLE**: Modify table schema.
    

----------

**5. CRUD Operations**

-   **Create (INSERT)**: Add new records.
    
-   **Read (SELECT)**: Retrieve records.
    
-   **Update (UPDATE)**: Modify existing records.
    
-   **Delete (DELETE)**: Remove records.
    

----------

**6. SQL Clauses**

-   **DISTINCT:** Return unique values.
    
-   **GROUP BY:** Aggregate data into groups.
    
-   **ORDER BY:** Sort results (ASC/DESC).
    
-   **HAVING:** Filter aggregated results.
    
-   **WHERE:** Filter rows based on conditions.
    

----------

**7. SQL Operators**

-   **LIKE:** Pattern matching.
    
-   **AND / OR / NOT:** Logical conditions.
    
-   **BETWEEN:** Filter within a range.
    
-   **=, !=, <, >, <=, >=:** Comparison operators.
    

----------

**8. SQL Functions**

-   **String Functions:** CONCAT(), GROUP_CONCAT(), SUBSTRING(), LENGTH().
    
-   **Aggregate Functions:** COUNT(), SUM(), MAX(), MIN().
    

----------

### **What I Learned**

-   Differences between relational and non-relational databases, and when to use each.
    
-   The structure and purpose of tables, columns, rows, primary keys, and foreign keys.
    
-   How to use SQL statements to create, modify, and delete databases and tables.
    
-   Performing CRUD operations for data management.
    
-   Using clauses to filter, group, and sort query results.
    
-   Applying logical and comparison operators to refine queries.
    
-   Utilizing SQL functions to manipulate and summarize data.
